Assignment — Week 1 (Beginner, NumPy Only)
Goal:
Learn how images are stored as matrices, how color channels work, and how simple filters affect images — all using NumPy, no OpenCV.


Part A — Pixel and Color Basics
Q1. Load and Display an Image
Use matplotlib.image.imread() to read any image of your choice.
* Print its shape.

* Check the range of pixel values (min, max).

* Display the image using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow().

Q2. Separate and Combine Channels
   1. Extract the R, G, and B channels using NumPy slicing.
Example:

R = img[:, :, 0]
G = img[:, :, 1]
B = img[:, :, 2]
      2. Display each channel separately in grayscale.

      3. Combine the channels back using np.stack([R, G, B], axis=-1) and show the recombined image.

Q3. Convert to Grayscale (Manually)
Use the formula:
Gray=0.299R+0.587G+0.114BGray = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114BGray=0.299R+0.587G+0.114B
Display the grayscale image and compare with np.mean(img, axis=2) (simple average).


Part B — Understanding Color Spaces
Q4. Create an Artificial RGB Image
Create a small (3×3) image manually as a NumPy array, like:
img = np.array([
  [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]],
  [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]],
  [[0.5,0.5,0.5],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
])


Print each pixel’s RGB values and describe what color you expect it to be.
Q5. Simple RGB to “Brightness”
Write a function:
def brightness(img):
    return np.max(img, axis=2)


Display the brightness map and note which areas look bright or dark.


Part C — Filters and Convolution
Q6. 3×3 Blur Filter
Write a function:
def blur_gray(img):
    kernel = np.ones((3,3)) / 9
    # use manual convolution (loops)
    ...


Apply it on your grayscale image and display the result.
(Hint: pad the borders with zeros using np.pad().)
Part D — Reflection
Answer briefly:
         1. What does a convolution kernel do?

         2. How does changing the kernel affect the output?

         3. Why does grayscale use weighted averages instead of a simple mean?
